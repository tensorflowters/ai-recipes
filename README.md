# AI Recipes

A comprehensive collection of AI/ML deployment recipes, configurations, and automation patterns for modern infrastructure.

## Vision

This workspace provides a curated namespace of battle-tested AI/ML deployment patterns, from development to production. Each "recipe" is a self-contained configuration that can be mixed, matched, and customized for your specific use case.

## Namespace Structure

The ai-recipes workspace is organized into logical namespaces:

- **`/containers/`** - Docker and container orchestration patterns
- **`/kubernetes/`** - K8s deployments, operators, and CRDs
- **`/cloud/`** - Cloud-native AI/ML services and infrastructure
- **`/local/`** - Local development and testing environments
- **`/ci-cd/`** - Continuous integration and deployment pipelines
- **`/monitoring/`** - Observability, logging, and monitoring setups
- **`/security/`** - Security patterns, policies, and configurations
- **`/data/`** - Data pipeline and storage configurations

- 📋 Clear prerequisites and dependencies
